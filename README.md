# sso-talk

A three-minute lecture I prepared for CMU's 76-270 Writing for the Professions about small string optimization, heavily researched from https://cedardb.com/blog/german_strings/ and https://pola.rs/posts/polars-string-type/.

`sso-talk-speaker-notes.pdf` is generated via Libreoffice Impress's print feature, though the same information should be embedded in the Powerpoint file.
